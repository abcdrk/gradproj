# gradproj

- **empalink-sample-project-android-2.2:** The sample project of Empatica offers. Need wristband around to make it work.
- **Timer:** Sample project to find out how timers are used.
- **CallLog:** gets the last 24 hours call number.
- **SensorData:** gets the light density and the acc values from the phone. Step counter and Yemperature can be added easily but my phone did not had those sensors so they are inactive.
- **gradproj:** Combines the sensors and the Empatica sample project with timer. Need the Wristband around to work.
